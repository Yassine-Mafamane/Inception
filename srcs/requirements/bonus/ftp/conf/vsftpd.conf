# Example config file /etc/vsftpd.conf
#
# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file
# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
# Please see vsftpd.conf.5 for all compiled in defaults.
#
# READ THIS: This example file is NOT an exhaustive list of vsftpd options.
# Please read the vsftpd.conf.5 manual page to get a full idea of vsftpd's
# capabilities.
#

# Controls whether anonymous logins are permitted or not. If enabled, 
# both the usernames ftp and anonymous are recognised as anonymous logins. 
# Default: YES
anonymous_enable=NO
#

# When enabled, and vsftpd is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd will background 
# the listener process. i.e. control will immediately be returned to the shell 
# which launched vsftpd.
# Default: YES 
background=NO
#

# When enabled, allows use of the SITE CHMOD command. 
# NOTE! This only applies to local users. Anonymous users never get to use SITE CHMOD. 
# Default: Yes
chmod_enable=YES
#

# If set to YES, local users will be (by default) placed in a chroot() jail in their 
# home directory after login. Warning: This option has security implications, especially 
# if the users have upload permission, or shell access. Only enable if you know what 
# you are doing. 
# Note that these security implications are not vsftpd specific. 
# They apply to all FTP daemons which offer to put local users in chroot() jails.
# Default: NO 
chroot_local_user=YES
#

#passwd_chroot_enable=YES

# If true, any failed upload files are deleted. (Added in v2.0.7).
# Default : NO
delete_failed_uploads=YES
#

# TODO : Add .message file in startup
# If enabled, users of the FTP server can be shown messages when they first enter 
# a new directory. By default, a directory is scanned for the file .message, 
# but that may be overridden with the configuration setting message_file. 
# Default : NO
dirmessage_enable=YES
#

# If activated, files and directories starting with . will be shown in directory 
# listings even if the "a" flag was not used by the client. 
# This override excludes the "." and ".." entries.
# Default : NO 
force_dot_files=YES
#

# If enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. 
# This means that vsftpd must not be run from an inetd of some kind. 
# They're service launchers that listen for network connections and start services on-demand.
# Instead, the vsftpd executable is run once directly. 
# vsftpd itself will then take care of listening for and handling incoming connections. 
# Default = NO
listen=YES
#

#Controls whether local logins are permitted or not. 
# If enabled, normal user accounts in /etc/passwd (or wherever your PAM config 
# references) may be used to log in. 
# This must be enable for any non-anonymous login to work, including virtual users.
# Default : No
local_enable=YES
#

#This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are allowed 
# or not. These commands are: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE and SITE.
#Default: NO 
write_enable=YES
#

#The permissions with which uploaded files are created. 
# Umasks are applied on top of this value. 
#You may wish to change to 0777 if you want uploaded files to be executable.
# Default: 0666 
file_open_mode=0666
#

# If vsftpd is in standalone mode, 
# this is the port it will listen on for incoming FTP connections. 
listen_port=21
#

# This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into after 
# a local (i.e. non-anonymous) login. Failure is silently ignored.
# Default: (none) 
local_root=/var/www/html
#

# This is the name of the user that is used by vsftpd when it wants to be totally unprivileged. 
# Note that this should be a dedicated user, rather than nobody. 
# The user nobody tends to be used for rather a lot of important things on most machines. 
# Default: nobody 
#nopriv_user=ftpsecure
#

allow_writeable_chroot=YES

# seccomp = secure computing mode
# It's a Linux kernel security feature that restricts which system calls a process can make.
seccomp_sandbox=NO
