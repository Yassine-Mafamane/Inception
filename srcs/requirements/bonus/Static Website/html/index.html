                <p>
                    The Inception project is a comprehensive system administration exercise focused on
                    containerization and infrastructure setup using Docker technology. The goal is to
                    create a small but complete infrastructure composed of multiple services, each
                    running in dedicated containers.
                </p>

                <h2>Docker & Containerization</h2>
                <p>
                    Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications that fundamentally
                    changes how we manage infrastructure. It enables you to package and run applications in lightweight,
                    isolated environments called containers. Unlike traditional virtual machines that require a full
                    operating system for each instance, containers share the host's kernel while maintaining isolation,
                    making them significantly more efficient and faster to start. Each container includes everything
                    needed to run the application—code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies—ensuring consistency across
                    different environments without relying on what's installed on the host.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The power of Docker lies in its portability and consistency. Containers can run seamlessly on a
                    developer's laptop, physical or virtual machines in data centers, cloud providers, or any mixture of
                    environments. This portability enables reliable workflows: development teams write code in Docker
                    environments, push containers for testing, and when bugs are discovered, they can quickly fix issues
                    and redeploy the updated container with confidence that it will work identically everywhere. This
                    approach, known as continuous delivery, eliminates the classic "it works on my machine" problem. By
                    containerizing applications with all their dependencies, this project leverages Docker to create an
                    isolated, reproducible, and scalable infrastructure that can be shared and deployed with guaranteed
                    consistency.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Docker?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Each service runs in its own container with dedicated resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> The entire infrastructure can be deployed anywhere</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Containers share the host OS kernel, reducing overhead</li>
                    <li><strong>Reproducibility:</strong> Infrastructure as code ensures consistent deployments</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
                <p>
                    All Docker images are built from scratch using custom Dockerfiles based on Alpine or Debian. The
                    project uses Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers, defining services, networks, and
                    volumes in a single configuration file. Each container is designed to run a single process as PID 1,
                    following Docker best practices. A Makefile automates the entire deployment workflow, handling data
                    directory creation, container orchestration, and cleanup operations for consistent and reproducible
                    deployments.

            <section id="vault">
                <h2>Vault - Secret Management (Additional Service)</h2>
                <p>
                    HashiCorp Vault was chosen as an additional bonus service to provide secure,
                    centralized secret management for the infrastructure. This addresses a critical
                    security concern in containerized environments.
                </p>

                <h3>Why Vault?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit</li>
                    <li><strong>Centralized Management:</strong> Single source of truth for all credentials</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic Secrets:</strong> Can generate credentials on-demand with automatic expiration
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Audit Logging:</strong> Complete audit trail of secret access</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Fine-grained policies control who can access what</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Implementation</h3>
                <p>
                    Vault runs as a dedicated container in the infrastructure. Instead of hardcoding
                    passwords in environment variables or files, sensitive credentials (database passwords,
                    API keys, SSL certificates) are stored in Vault's encrypted storage.
                </p>

                <div class="architecture-info">
                    <strong>Security Flow:</strong>
                    <ol style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                        <li>Services authenticate with Vault using the AppRole method for automated credential retrieval
                        </li>
                        <li>Vault generates TLS certificates signed by a Vault-managed root CA, enabling certificate
                            revocation, expiration checks, and centralized trust management</li>
                        <li>Database credentials are dynamically generated with short lifespans and can be revoked
                            instantly in case of breaches or team member departures</li>
                        <li>Vault verifies identities, enforces access policies, and grants only the necessary secrets
                            to each service</li>
                        <li>All secrets are injected at runtime and never stored in container images or configuration
                            files</li>
                        <li>In case of security incidents or credential leaks, Vault can be sealed to prevent access
                            until the situation is resolved</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>
                    This approach eliminates the risk of accidentally committing secrets to Git,
                    provides rotation capabilities for credentials, and offers a professional-grade
                    solution for managing sensitive data in production environments.

                    <p>While this project demonstrates a functional containerized infrastructure, several security

                        <li><strong>Non-Root Container Users:</strong> Containers should run as non-privileged users instead
                            of root to minimize the impact of potential container breakouts and follow the principle of
                            least privilege.</li>
    
                        <li><strong>Vault Root Token Management:</strong> The root token should be revoked after initial
                            setup and authentication should rely solely on AppRole or other secure methods. Root tokens
                            should never be left accessible in production environments.</li>
    
                        <li><strong>Encrypted Communication:</strong>
                            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 5px;">
                                <li>Vault communication should use TLS/SSL encryption to protect secrets in transit</li>
                                <li>FTP should be replaced with SFTP or FTPS to encrypt file transfers</li>
                            </ul>
